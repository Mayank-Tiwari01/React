### Updated Code Explanation

```javascript
const heading = React.createElement('h1', {className: 'heading'}, 'Hello react');
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(heading);
```

### Understanding React Elements

#### React.createElement

- **Syntax**:
  ```javascript
  React.createElement(type, [props], [...children])
  ```

- **Parameters**:
  - `type`: This is the type of the HTML element or React component you want to create. In this case, `'h1'`.
  - `props`: This is an object containing the properties (attributes) you want to set on the element. Here, `{className: 'heading'}` sets the `className` attribute to `'heading'`.
  - `children`: These are the child elements or content to be nested inside the created element. Here, `'Hello react'` is the text content inside the `<h1>` element.

### Understanding Props and Children

- **Props**:
  - Props are short for "properties".
  - They are used to pass data and configurations to React elements.
  - In your example, `{className: 'heading'}` is a prop that sets the class of the `<h1>` element to `'heading'`.

- **Children**:
  - Children are the elements or content nested inside a React element.
  - In your example, `'Hello react'` is a child, which is the text content inside the `<h1>` element.

### React Elements as JavaScript Objects

- **React Elements**:
  - When you create a React element using `React.createElement`, it returns a JavaScript object that describes the element.
  - This object contains information about the type of the element, its props, and its children.

  For example:
  ```javascript
  const heading = React.createElement('h1', {className: 'heading'}, 'Hello react');
  ```

  This creates a React element represented by a JavaScript object similar to this:
  ```javascript
  {
    type: 'h1',
    props: {
      className: 'heading',
      children: 'Hello react'
    }
  }
  ```

### Rendering the React Element

- **ReactDOM.createRoot**:
  - This method creates a root DOM node that React will control.
  - It takes a DOM element (in this case, the one with id `root`) as its argument.

  ```javascript
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
  ```

- **root.render**:
  - This method renders the React element (the JavaScript object) into the actual DOM.
  - It converts the JavaScript object representation of the React element into real HTML that the browser can display.

  ```javascript
  root.render(heading);
  ```

### Summary

- **React Elements are JavaScript Objects**: Yes, a React element is essentially a JavaScript object that describes what you want to display.
- **Props**: The second parameter in `React.createElement` is called props. They are used to pass data and configuration to React elements.
- **Children**: The third parameter in `React.createElement` is called children. It represents the content or elements nested inside the React element.

### Additional Example

To illustrate further, here's an example with more complexity:

```javascript
const subHeading = React.createElement('h2', {}, 'Welcome to learning React');
const paragraph = React.createElement('p', {}, 'React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.');
const container = React.createElement('div', {className: 'container'}, subHeading, paragraph);

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(container);
```

In this example:
- `subHeading` and `paragraph` are individual React elements.
- `container` is a React element with two children: `subHeading` and `paragraph`.

When rendered, this will display:

```html
<div class="container">
  <h2>Welcome to learning React</h2>
  <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</p>
</div>
```

This showcases how you can build more complex UI structures using nested React elements. If you have more questions or need further explanation, feel free to ask!
